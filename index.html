  <h2 >What is an abortion?</h2>
    
    <h3>An abortion is a procedure to end a pregnancy. It can be done two different ways:</h3>
 <br>
  <h4>In-clinic Abortion </h4>
  
  <li>
    A doctor or nurse uses medical instruments and gentle suction to take the pregnancy out of your uterus through your vagina.
</li>
  <br>
  <h4>Medication Abortion</h4>
 
  <li>
    You take pills that end your pregnancy and cause cramping and bleeding so the pregnancy tissue comes out of your uterus through your vagina. It’s like an early miscarriage.
  </li>
  <br>
  <p>Both in-clinic and medication abortions are very safe. In fact, abortion is one of the safest medical procedures out there — it has a lower complication rate than other common medical procedures and abortion pills are safer than medicines like penicillin, Tylenol, and Viagra. </p>

    <h2>The Hard Truth</h2>

        
     <br>
     

      <li>
        Removing a wisdom tooth is more complicated than providing a safe abortion procedure. Women are completely safe in doing this procedure when they go to a health service provider. In other words, when it’s legal, it’s done safely. 

    </li>
      <br>
    
      <li>
        “68,000 women die of unsafe abortion annually, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality rate (13%)” “Methods of unsafe abortion include drinking toxic fluids such as turpentine, bleach, or drinkable concoctions mixed with livestock manure.” “The main causes of death from unsafe abortion are hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, genital trauma, and necrotic bowel.” This shows that women are willing to go to such lengths to terminate an abortion and that those diy abortions are likely to kill the woman.


      </li>
      <br>

      <li>
        “More than 150 economists wrote in a Supreme Court amicus brief that access to legal abortion has led to lower rates of children in poverty, as well as mothers attaining higher levels of education and professional occupations.”
